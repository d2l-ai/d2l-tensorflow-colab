    "Python is an *interpreted language*. When evaluating the above `fancy_func` function it performs the operations making up the function's body *in sequence*. That is, it will evaluate `e = add(a, b)` and store the results as variable `e`, thereby changing the program's state. The next two statements `f = add(c, d)` and `g = add(e, f)` will be executed similarly, performing additions and storing the results as variables. :numref:`fig_compute_graph` illustrates the flow of data.\n",

On the one hand, even if the `add` function is repeatedly called throughout `fancy_func`, Python will execute the three function calls individually. If these are executed, say, on a GPU (or even on multiple GPUs), the overhead arising from the Python interpreter can become overwhelming. Moreover, it will need to save the variable values of `e` and `f` until all the statements in `fancy_func` have been executed.

    "Second, a compiler might optimize and rewrite the above code into `print((1 + 2) + (3 + 4))` or even `print(10)`. This is possible since a compiler gets to see the full code before turning it into machine instructions. For instance, it can release memory (or never allocate it) whenever a variable is no longer needed. Or it can transform the code entirely into an equivalent piece.\n",

    "The easiest way to get a feel for how hybridization works is to consider deep networks with multiple layers. Conventionally the Python interpreter will need to execute the code for all layers to generate an instruction that can then be forwarded to a CPU or a GPU. For a single (fast) computing device this does not cause any major issues. On the other hand, if we use an advanced 8-GPU server such as an AWS P3dn.24xlarge instance Python will struggle to keep all GPUs busy. The single-threaded Python interpreter becomes the bottleneck here. Let's see how we can address this for significant parts of the code by replacing `Sequential` with `HybridSequential`. We begin by defining a simple MLP.\n"
