The only way the direction we pick enters into this equation is through $\\cos(\\theta)$, and thus we wish to make this cosine as negative as possible.  Now, recalling the shape of cosine, we can make this as negative as possible by making $\\cos(\\theta) = -1$ or equivalently making the angle between the gradient and our chosen direction to be $\\pi$ radians, or equivalently $180$ degrees.

However, due to the plethora of ways matrix operations can be combined compared to single values, there are many more matrix derivative rules than single variable ones.  It is often the case that it is best to work with the indices, or leave it up to automatic differentiation when appropriate.\n",

    "* In higher dimensions, we can define gradients which serve the same purpose as derivatives in one dimension.  These allow us to see how a multi-variable function changes when we make an arbitrary small change to the inputs.\n",
    "* The backpropagation algorithm can be seen to be a method of organizing the multi-variable chain rule to allow for the efficient computation of many partial derivatives.\n",
    "* Matrix calculus allows us to write the derivatives of matrix expressions in concise ways.\n",

    "1. Given a column vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, compute the derivatives of both $f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^\\top\\mathbf{x}$ and $g(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^\\top\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$.  Why do you get the same answer?\n",
    "2. Let $\\mathbf{v}$ be an $n$ dimension vector. What is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\mathbf{v}}\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2$?\n",
    "3. Let $L(x, y) = \\log(e^x + e^y)$.  Compute the gradient.  What is the sum of the components of the gradient?\n",
    "4. Let $f(x, y) = x^2y + xy^2$. Show that the only critical point is $(0,0)$. By considering $f(x, x)$, determine if $(0,0)$ is a maximum, minimum, or neither.\n",
    "5. Suppose that we are minimizing a function $f(\\mathbf{x}) = g(\\mathbf{x}) + h(\\mathbf{x})$.  How can we geometrically interpret the condition of $\\nabla f = 0$ in terms of $g$ and $h$?\n"
