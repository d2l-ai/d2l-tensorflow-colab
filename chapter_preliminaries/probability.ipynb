    "Depending on our objective, \n",

    "For example, given some features \n",
    "describing a patient,\n",
    "we might want to know *how likely* they are\n",
    "to suffer a heart attack in the next year. \n",
    "In unsupervised learning, \n",
    "we often care about uncertainty. \n",
    "To determine whether a set of measurements are anomalous,\n",

    "e.g., what is the *probability* \n",

    "probability provides unambiguous rules\n",

    "## A Simple Example: Tossing Coins\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we plan to toss a coin\n",
    "and want to quantify how likely\n",
    "we are to see heads (vs. tails).\n",
    "If the coin is *fair*, \n",
    "then both outcomes \n",
    "(heads and tails), \n",
    "are equally likely.\n",
    "Moreover if we plan to toss the coin $n$ times\n",
    "then the fraction of heads \n",
    "that we *expect* to see\n",
    "should exactly match\n",
    "the *expected* fraction of tails.\n",
    "One intuitive way to see this\n",
    "is by symmetry:\n",
    "for every possible outcome\n",
    "with $n_h$ heads and $n_t = (n - n_h)$ tails,\n",
    "there is an equally likely outcome\n",
    "with $n_t$ heads and $n_h$ tails.\n",
    "Note that this is only possible \n",
    "if on average we expect to see\n",
    "$1/2$ of tosses come up heads \n",
    "and $1/2$ come up tails.\n",
    "Of course, if you conduct this experiment \n",
    "many times with $n=1000000$ tosses each,\n",
    "you might never see a trial\n",
    "where $n_h = n_t$ exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the quantity $1/2$ is called a *probability*\n",
    "and here it captures the certainty with which \n",
    "any given toss will come up heads.\n",
    "Probabilities assign scores between $0$ and $1$\n",
    "to outcomes of interest, called *events*.\n",
    "Here the event of interest is $\\textrm{heads}$\n",
    "and we denote the corresponding probability $P(\\textrm{heads})$.\n",
    "A probability of $1$ indicates absolute certainty \n",
    "(imagine a trick coin where both sides were heads)\n",
    "and a probability of $0$ indicates impossibility\n",
    "(e.g., if both sides were tails). \n",
    "The frequencies $n_h/n$ and $n_t/n$ are not probabilities\n",
    "but rather *statistics*.\n",
    "Probabilities are *theoretical* quantities \n",
    "that underly the data generating process.\n",
    "Here, the probability $1/2$ \n",
    "is a property of the coin itself.\n",
    "By contrast, statistics are *empirical* quantities\n",
    "that are computed as functions of the observed data.\n",
    "Our interests in probabilistic and statistical quantities\n",
    "are inextricably intertwined.\n",
    "We often design special statistics called *estimators*\n",
    "that, given a dataset, produce *estimates* \n",
    "of model parameters like probabilities.\n",
    "Moreover, when those estimators satisfy \n",
    "a nice property called *consistency*,\n",
    "our estimates will converge \n",
    "to the corresponding probability.\n",
    "In turn, these inferred probabilities\n",

    "we can toss the coin many times\n",
    "and record all of the outcomes.\n",
    "Formally, drawing realizations \n",

    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",
    "coming up odds or the first coin toss coming up heads,\n",
    "we were invoking the idea of a *random variable*.\n",
    "Formally, random variables are mappings\n",
    "from an underlying sample space \n",
    "to a set of (possibly many) values.\n",
    "You might wonder how a random variable \n",
    "is different from the sample space,\n",
    "since both are collections of outcomes. \n",
    "Importantly, random variables can be much coarser \n",
    "than the raw sample space.\n",
    "We can define a binary random variable like \"greater than 0.5\"\n",
    "even when the underlying sample space is infinite,\n",
    "e.g., the line segment between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "Additionally, multiple random variables\n",
    "can share the same underlying sample space.\n",
    "For example \"whether my home alarm goes off\"\n",
    "and \"whether my house was burglarized\"\n",
    "are both binary random variables \n",
    "that share an underlying sample space. \n",
    "Consequently, knowing the value taken by one random variable \n",
    "can tell us something about the likely value of another random variable.\n",
    "Knowing that the alarm went off, \n",
    "we might suspect that the house was likely burglarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value taken by a random variable corresponds \n",
    "to a subset of the underlying sample space.\n",
    "Thus the occurrence where the random variable $X$\n",
    "takes value $v$, denoted by $X=v$, is an *event*\n",
    "and $P(X=v)$ denotes its probability.\n",
    "Sometimes this notation can get clunky,\n",
    "and we can abuse notation when the context is clear.\n",
    "For example, we might use $P(X)$ to refer broadly\n",
    "to the *distribution* of $X$, i.e., \n",
    "the function that tells us the probability\n",
    "that $X$ takes any given value. \n",
    "Other times we write expressions \n",
    "like $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$,\n",
    "as a shorthand to express a statement \n",
    "that is true for all of the values\n",
    "that the random variables $X$ and $Y$ can take, i.e.,\n",
    "for all $i,j$ it holds that $P(X=i \\textrm{ and } Y=j) = P(X=i)P(Y=j)$.\n",
    "Other times, we abuse notation by writing\n",
    "$P(v)$ when the random variable is clear from the context. \n",
    "Since an event in probability theory is a set of outcomes from the sample space,\n",
    "we can specify a range of values for a random variable to take.\n",
    "For example, $P(1 \\leq X \\leq 3)$ denotes the probability of the event $\\{1 \\leq X \\leq 3\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a subtle difference \n",
    "between *discrete* random variables,\n",
    "like flips of a coin or tosses of a die, \n",
    "and *continuous* ones,\n",
    "like the weight and the height of a person\n",
    "sampled at random from the population.\n",
    "In this case we seldom really care about \n",
    "someone's exact height. \n",
    "Moreover, if we took precise enough measurements,\n",
    "we would find that no two people on the planet \n",
    "have the exact same height. \n",
    "In fact, with fine enough measurements, \n",
    "you would never have the same height \n",
    "when you wake up and when you go to sleep. \n",
    "There's little point in asking about \n",
    "the exact probability that someone \n",
    "is 1.801392782910287192 meters tall. \n",
    "Instead, we typically care more about being able to say\n",
    "whether someone's height falls into a given interval, \n",
    "say between 1.79 and 1.81 meters. \n",
    "In these cases we work with probability *densities*. \n",
    "The height of exactly 1.80 meters \n",
    "has no probability, but nonzero density. \n",
    "To get out the probability assigned to an interval,\n",
    "we must take an *integral* of the density \n",
    "over that interval. \n",

    "## Multiple Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that we couldn't even\n",

    "making statements involving interactions \n",
    "among multiple random variables\n",
    "(recall $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$).\n",
    "Most of machine learning \n",
    "is concerned with such relationships.\n",
    "Here, the sample space would be \n",
    "the population of interest,\n",
    "say customers who transact with a business,\n",
    "photographs on the internet,\n",
    "or proteins known to biologists.\n",
    "Each random variable would represent \n",
    "the (unknown) value of a different attribute. \n",
    "Whenever we sample an individual from the population,\n",
    "we observe a realization of each of the random variables.\n",
    "Because the values taken by random variables \n",
    "correspond to subsets of the sample space \n",
    "that could be overlapping, partially overlapping, \n",
    "or entirely disjoint,\n",
    "knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can cause us to update our beliefs \n",
    "about what values of another random variable are likely.\n",
    "If a patient walks into a hospital \n",
    "and we observe that they \n",
    "are having trouble breathing\n",
    "and have lost their sense of smell,\n",
    "then we believe that they are more likely\n",
    "to have COVID-19 than we might \n",
    "if they had no trouble breathing\n",
    "and a perfectly ordinary sense of smell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with multiple random variables,\n",
    "we can construct events corresponding \n",
    "to every combination of values \n",
    "that the variables can jointly take.\n",
    "The probability function that assigns\n",
    "probabilities to each of these combinations\n",
    "(e.g. $A=a$ and $B=b$)\n",
    "is called the *joint probability* function\n",
    "and simply returns the probability assigned \n",
    "to the intersection of the corresponding subsets\n",
    "of the sample space. \n",
    "The *joint probability* assigned to the event \n",
    "where random variables $A$ and $B$ \n",
    "take values $a$ and $b$, respectively,\n",
    "is denoted $P(A = a, B = b)$,\n",
    "where the comma indicates \"and\". \n",
    "Note that for any values $a$ and $b$,\n",
    "it holds that\n",
    "$P(A=a, B=b) \\leq P(A=a)$ \n",
    "and $P(A=a, B=b) \\leq P(B = b)$,\n",
    "since for $A=a$ and $B=b$ to happen,\n",
    "$A=a$ has to happen *and* $B=b$ also has to happen.\n",
    "Interestingly, the joint probability\n",
    "tells us all that we can know about these\n",
    "random variables in a probabilistic sense,\n",
    "and can be used to derive many other\n",
    "useful quantities, including recovering the \n",
    "individual distributions $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.\n",
    "To recover $P(A=a) $we simply sum up \n",

    "\n",
    "The ratio $\\frac{P(A=a, B=b)}{P(A=a)} \\leq 1$\n",
    "turns out to be extremely important.\n",
    "It is called the *conditional probability*,\n",
    "and is denoted via the \"|\" symbol,\n",
    "$P(B=b|A=a) = P(A=a,B=b)/P(A=a)$.\n",
    "It tells us the new probability\n",
    "associated with the event $B=b$,\n",
    "once we condition on the fact $A=a$ took place.\n",
    "We can think of this conditional probability\n",
    "as restricting attention only to the subset\n",
    "of the sample space associated with $A=a$\n",
    "and then renormalizing so that\n",
    "all probabilities sum to 1.\n",
    "Conditional probabilities \n",
    "are in fact probabilities\n",
    "and thus respect all of the axioms,\n",
    "so long as we condition all terms \n",
    "on the same event and thus \n",
    "restrict attention to the same sample space. \n",

    "Using the definition of conditional probabilities, \n",
    "we can derive the famous result called *Bayes' theorem*.\n",

    "If we know how to estimate $P(B|A)$, $P(A)$, and $P(B)$,\n",
    "then we can estimate $P(A|B)$. \n",
    "We often find it easier to estimate one term directly \n",
    "but not the other and Bayes' theorem can come to the rescue here.\n",
    "For instance, if we know the prevalence of symptoms for a given disease,\n",
    "and the overall prevalences of the disease and symptoms, respectively,\n",
    "we can determine how likely someone is \n",
    "to have the disease based on their symptoms.\n",
    "In some cases we might not have direct access to $P(B)$, \n",
    "such as the prevalence of symptoms. \n",
    "In this case a simplified version of Bayes' theorem comes in handy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) \\propto P(B|A) P(A).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that $P(A|B)$ must be normalized to $1$, i.e., $\\sum_a P(A=a|B) = 1$,\n",

    "In Bayesian statistics, we think of an observer \n",
    "as possessing some (subjective) prior beliefs\n",
    "about the plausibility of the available hypotheses \n",

    "one is to observe any value of the collected evidence \n",
    "for each of the hypotheses in the class $P(E|H)$.\n",
    "Bayes' theorem is then interpreted as telling us\n",

    "we can get away with simply normalizing over the hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\sum_a P(A=a|B) = 1$ also allows us to *marginalize* over random variables. That is, we can drop variables from a joint distribution such as $P(A, B)$. After all, we have that \n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, there are many things to be uncertain about!\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the value of a label given an input.\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the estimated value of a parameter.\n",
    "We can even be uncertain about whether data arriving at deployment\n",
    "is even from the same distribution as the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By *aleatoric uncertainty*, we denote that uncertainty \n",
    "that is intrinsic to the problem, \n",
    "and due to genuine randomness \n",
    "unaccounted for by the observed variables.\n",
    "By *epistemic uncertainty*, we denote uncertainty\n",
    "over a model's parameters, the sort of uncertainty\n",
    "that we can hope to reduce by collecting more data.\n",
    "We might have epistemic uncertainty \n",
    "concerning the probability \n",
    "that a coin turns up heads,\n",
    "but even once we know this probability,\n",
    "we are left with aleatoric uncertainty \n",
    "about the outcome of any future toss.\n",
    "No matter how long we watch someone tossing a fair coin, \n",
    "we will never be more or less than 50% certain \n",
    "that the next toss will come up heads.\n",
    "These terms owe to literature in mechanical modeling,\n",
    "(see e.g., :cite:`Der-Kiureghian.Ditlevsen.2009` for a review on this aspect of [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)).\n",
    "It's worth noting that these terms constitute a slight abuse of language.\n",
    "The term *epistemic* refers to anything concerning *knowledge*\n",
    "and thus in the philosophical sense, all uncertainty is epistemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that sampling data from some unknown probability distribution \n",
    "can provide us with information that can be used to estimate\n",
    "the parameters of the data generating distribution.\n",
    "That said, the rate at which this is possible can be quite slow. \n",
    "In our coin tossing example (and many others) \n",
    "we can do no better than to design estimators\n",
    "that converge at a rate of $1/\\sqrt{n}$,\n",
    "where $n$ is the sample size (e.g., the number of tosses). \n",
    "This means that by going from 10 to 1000 observations (usually a very achievable task) \n",
    "we see a tenfold reduction of uncertainty, \n",
    "whereas the next 1000 observations help comparatively little, \n",
    "offering only a 1.41 times reduction. \n",
    "This is a persistent feature of machine learning: \n",
    "while there are often easy gains, it takes a very large amount of data, \n",
    "and often with it an enormous amount of computation to make even further gains. \n",
    "For an empirical review of this fact for large scale language models see :cite:`Revels.Lubin.Papamarkou.2016`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also sharpened our language and tools for statistical modeling. \n",

    "how well observations $B$ match a choice of parameters $A$,\n",

    "the prevalence of the disease itself (i.e., our prior).\n",

    "Lastly, we introduced a first set of nontrivial questions \n",

    "For instance, [Chebyshev's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality)\n",

    "1. Assume that we have a sequence of random variables, say $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $B$ only depends on $A$, and $C$ only depends on $B$, can you simplify the joint probability $P(A, B, C)$? Hint: this is a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
    "1. In :numref:`subsec_probability_hiv_app`, assume that the outcomes of the two tests are not independent.

Moreover, assume that for $H = 1$ (infected) the test outcomes are conditionally independent, i.e., that $P(D_1, D_2|H=1) = P(D_1|H=1) P(D_2|H=1)$ but that for healthy patients the outcomes are coupled via $P(D_1 = D_2 = 1|H=0) = 0.02$. \n",
