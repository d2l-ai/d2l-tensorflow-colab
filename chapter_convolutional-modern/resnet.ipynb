    "As we design increasingly deeper networks it becomes imperative to understand how adding layers can increase the complexity and expressiveness of the network.\n",
    "Even more important is the ability to design networks where adding layers makes networks strictly more expressive rather than just different.\n",
    "To make some progress we need a bit of mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider $\\mathcal{F}$, the class of functions that a specific network architecture (together with learning rates and other hyperparameter settings) can reach.\n",
    "That is, for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ there exists some set of parameters (e.g., weights and biases) that can be obtained through training on a suitable dataset.\n",
    "Let us assume that $f^*$ is the \"truth\" function that we really would like to find.\n",
    "If it is in $\\mathcal{F}$, we are in good shape but typically we will not be quite so lucky.\n",
    "Instead, we will try to find some $f^*_\\mathcal{F}$ which is our best bet within $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "For instance, \n",
    "given a dataset with features $\\mathbf{X}$\n",
    "and labels $\\mathbf{y}$,\n",
    "we might try finding it by solving the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f^*_\\mathcal{F} \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=} \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_f L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{y}, f) \\text{ subject to } f \\in \\mathcal{F}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is only reasonable to assume that if we design a different and more powerful architecture $\\mathcal{F}'$ we should arrive at a better outcome. In other words, we would expect that $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ is \"better\" than $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}}$. However, if $\\mathcal{F} \\not\\subseteq \\mathcal{F}'$ there is no guarantee that this should even happen. In fact, $f^*_{\\mathcal{F}'}$ might well be worse. \n",
    "As illustrated by :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",
    "for non-nested function classes, a larger function class does not always move closer to the \"truth\" function $f^*$. For instance,\n",
    "on the left of :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",
    "though $\\mathcal{F}_3$ is closer to $f^*$ than $\\mathcal{F}_1$, $\\mathcal{F}_6$ moves away and there is no guarantee that further increasing the complexity can reduce the distance from $f^*$.\n",
    "With nested function classes\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{F}_1 \\subseteq \\ldots \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_6$\n",
    "on the right of :numref:`fig_functionclasses`,\n",
    "we can avoid the aforementioned issue from the non-nested function classes.\n",

    "This is the question that He et al. considered when working on very deep computer vision models :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016`. \n",

Then, we skip these two convolution operations and add the input directly before the final ReLU activation function.\n",
    "This kind of design requires that the output of the two convolutional layers has to be of the same shape as the input, so that they can be added together. If we want to change the number of channels, we need to introduce an additional $1\\times 1$ convolutional layer to transform the input into the desired shape for the addition operation.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nested function classes are desirable. Learning an additional layer in deep neural networks as an identity function (though this is an extreme case) should be made easy.\n",
    "* The residual mapping can learn the identity function more easily, such as pushing parameters in the weight layer to zero.\n",
    "* We can train an effective deep neural network by having residual blocks. Inputs can forward propagate faster through the residual connections across layers.\n",
    "* ResNet had a major influence on the design of subsequent deep neural networks, both for convolutional and sequential nature.\n",

    "1. What are the major differences between the Inception block in :numref:`fig_inception` and the residual block? After removing some paths in the Inception block, how are they related to each other?\n",
    "1. Refer to Table 1 in the ResNet paper :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016` to\n",
    "   implement different variants.\n",
    "1. For deeper networks, ResNet introduces a \"bottleneck\" architecture to reduce\n",
    "   model complexity. Try to implement it.\n",
    "1. In subsequent versions of ResNet, the authors changed the \"convolution, batch\n",
    "   normalization, and activation\" structure to the \"batch normalization,\n",
    "   activation, and convolution\" structure. Make this improvement\n",
    "   yourself. See Figure 1 in :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016*1`\n",
    "   for details.\n",
    "1. Why can't we just increase the complexity of functions without bound, even if the function classes are nested?\n"
