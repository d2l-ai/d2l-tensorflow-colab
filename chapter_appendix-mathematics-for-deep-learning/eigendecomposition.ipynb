    "# Eigendecompositions\n",
    ":label:`sec_eigendecompositions`\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues are often one of the most useful notions \n",
    "we will encounter when studying linear algebra, \n",
    "however, as a beginner, it is easy to overlook their importance.\n",
    "Below, we introduce eigendecomposition and \n",
    "try to convey some sense of just why it is so important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we have a matrix $A$ with the following entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "2 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & -1\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we apply $A$ to any vector $\\mathbf{v} = [x, y]^\\top$, \n",
    "we obtain a vector $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} = [2x, -y]^\\top$.\n",
    "This has an intuitive interpretation:\n",
    "stretch the vector to be twice as wide in the $x$-direction,\n",
    "and then flip it in the $y$-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are *some* vectors for which something remains unchanged.\n",
    "Namely $[1, 0]^\\top$ gets sent to $[2, 0]^\\top$\n",
    "and $[0, 1]^\\top$ gets sent to $[0, -1]^\\top$.\n",
    "These vectors are still in the same line,\n",
    "and the only modification is that the matrix stretches them\n",
    "by a factor of $2$ and $-1$ respectively.\n",
    "We call such vectors *eigenvectors*\n",
    "and the factor they are stretched by *eigenvalues*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if we can find a number $\\lambda$ \n",
    "and a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ such that \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that $\\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector for $A$ and $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding Eigenvalues\n",
    "Let's figure out how to find them. By subtracting off the $\\lambda \\mathbf{v}$ from both sides,\n",
    "and then factoring out the vector,\n",
    "we see the above is equivalent to:\n",

    "$$(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{v} = 0.$$\n",
    ":eqlabel:`eq_eigvalue_der`\n",

    "For :eqref:`eq_eigvalue_der` to happen, we see that $(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I})$ \n",
    "must compress some direction down to zero, \n",
    "hence it is not invertible, and thus the determinant is zero.\n",
    "Thus, we can find the *eigenvalues* \n",
    "by finding for what $\\lambda$ is $\\det(\\mathbf{A}-\\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$.\n",
    "Once we find the eigenvalues, we can solve \n",
    "$\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v}$ \n",

    "\n",
    "## Operations on Eigendecompositions\n",
    "One nice thing about eigendecompositions :eqref:`eq_eig_decomp` is that \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{A}^n = \\overbrace{\\mathbf{A}\\cdots \\mathbf{A}}^{\\text{$n$ times}} = \\overbrace{(\\mathbf{W}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{W}^{-1})\\cdots(\\mathbf{W}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{W}^{-1})}^{\\text{$n$ times}} =  \\mathbf{W}\\overbrace{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\cdots\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}^{\\text{$n$ times}}\\mathbf{W}^{-1} = \\mathbf{W}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^n \\mathbf{W}^{-1}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that for any positive power of a matrix,\n",
    "the eigendecomposition is obtained by just raising the eigenvalues to the same power.\n",
    "The same can be shown for negative powers,\n",
    "so if we want to invert a matrix we need only consider\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \\mathbf{W}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{-1} \\mathbf{W}^{-1},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or in other words, just invert each eigenvalue.\n",
    "This will work as long as each eigenvalue is non-zero,\n",
    "so we see that invertible is the same as having no zero eigenvalues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, additional work can show that if $\\lambda_1, \\ldots, \\lambda_n$ \n",
    "are the eigenvalues of a matrix, then the determinant of that matrix is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\det(\\mathbf{A}) = \\lambda_1 \\cdots \\lambda_n,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or the product of all the eigenvalues.\n",
    "This makes sense intuitively because whatever stretching $\\mathbf{W}$ does, \n",
    "$W^{-1}$ undoes it, so in the end the only stretching that happens is \n",
    "by multiplication by the diagonal matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$, \n",
    "which stretches volumes by the product of the diagonal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, recall that the rank was the maximum number \n",
    "of linearly independent columns of your matrix.\n",
    "By examining the eigendecomposition closely,\n",
    "we can see that the rank is the same \n",
    "as the number of non-zero eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples could continue, but hopefully the point is clear:\n",
    "eigendecomposition can simplify many linear-algebraic computations\n",
    "and is a fundamental operation underlying many numerical algorithms\n",
    "and much of the analysis that we do in linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Eigendecompositions of Symmetric Matrices\n",
    "It is not always possible to find enough linearly independent eigenvectors \n",
    "for the above process to work. For instance the matrix\n",

    "has only a single eigenvector, namely $(1, 0)^\\top$. \n",
    "To handle such matrices, we require more advanced techniques \n",
    "than we can cover (such as the Jordan Normal Form, or Singular Value Decomposition).\n",
    "We will often need to restrict our attention to those matrices \n",
    "where we can guarantee the existence of a full set of eigenvectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly encountered family are the *symmetric matrices*,\n",
    "which are those matrices where $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A}^\\top$. \n",
    "In this case, we may take $W$ to be an *orthogonal matrix*—a matrix whose columns are all length one vectors that are at right angles to one another, where \n",
    "$\\mathbf{W}^\\top = \\mathbf{W}^{-1}$—and all the eigenvalues will be real.  \n",
    "Thus, in this special case, we can write :eqref:`eq_eig_decomp` as\n",

    "\n",
    "We see something a bit unexpected happening here: \n",
    "that number we identified before for the \n",
    "long term stretching of our matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ \n",
    "applied to a random vector is *exactly* \n",
    "(accurate to thirteen decimal places!) \n",
    "the largest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{A}$.\n",
    "This is clearly not a coincidence!\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we now think about what is happening geometrically,\n",
    "this starts to make sense. Consider a random vector. \n",
    "This random vector points a little in every direction, \n",
    "so in particular, it points at least a little bit \n",
    "in the same direction as the eigenvector of $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "associated with the largest eigenvalue.\n",
    "This is so important that it is called \n",
    "the *principle eigenvalue* and *principle eigenvector*.\n",
    "After applying $\\mathbf{A}$, our random vector \n",
    "gets stretched in every possible direction,\n",
    "as is associated with every possible eigenvector,\n",
    "but it is stretched most of all in the direction \n",
    "associated with this principle eigenvector.\n",
    "What this means is that after apply in $A$, \n",
    "our random vector is longer, and points in a direction \n",
    "closer to being aligned with the principle eigenvector.\n",
    "After applying the matrix many times, \n",
    "the alignment with the principle eigenvector becomes closer and closer until, \n",
    "for all practical purposes, our random vector has been transformed \n",
    "into the principle eigenvector!\n",
    "Indeed this algorithm is the basis \n",
    "for what is known as the *power iteration*\n",
    "for finding the largest eigenvalue and eigenvector of a matrix. For details see, for example, :cite:`Van-Loan.Golub.1983`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fixing the Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, from above discussions, we concluded \n",
    "that we do not want a random vector to be stretched or squished at all,\n",
    "we would like random vectors to stay about the same size throughout the entire process.\n",
    "To do so, we now rescale our matrix by this principle eigenvalue \n",
    "so that the largest eigenvalue is instead now just one.\n",
    "Let's see what happens in this case.\n"

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We now see exactly what we hoped for!\n",
    "After normalizing the matrices by the principal eigenvalue,\n",
    "we see that the random data does not explode as before,\n",
    "but rather eventually equilibrates to a specific value.\n",
    "It would be nice to be able to do these things from first principles,\n",
    "and it turns out that if we look deeply at the mathematics of it,\n",
    "we can see that the largest eigenvalue \n",
    "of a large random matrix with independent mean zero,\n",
    "variance one Gaussian entries is on average about $\\sqrt{n}$,\n",
    "or in our case $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.2$,\n",
    "due to a fascinating fact known as the *circular law* :cite:`Ginibre.1965`.\n",
    "The relationship between the eigenvalues (and a related object called singular values) of random matrices has been shown to have deep connections to proper initialization of neural networks as was discussed in :cite:`Pennington.Schoenholz.Ganguli.2017` and subsequent works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "* Eigenvectors are vectors which are stretched by a matrix without changing direction.\n",
    "* Eigenvalues are the amount that the eigenvectors are stretched by the application of the matrix.\n",
    "* The eigendecomposition of a matrix can allow for many operations to be reduced to operations on the eigenvalues.\n",
    "* The Gershgorin Circle Theorem can provide approximate values for the eigenvalues of a matrix.\n",
    "* The behavior of iterated matrix powers depends primarily on the size of the largest eigenvalue.  This understanding has many applications in the theory of neural network initialization.\n",
