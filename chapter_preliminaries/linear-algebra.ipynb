    ":label:`sec_linear-algebra`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you can store and manipulate data,\n",
    "let us briefly review the subset of basic linear algebra\n",
    "that you will need to understand and implement\n",
    "most of models covered in this book.\n",
    "Below, we introduce the basic mathematical objects, arithmetic,\n",
    "and operations in linear algebra,\n",
    "expressing each of them through mathematical notation\n",
    "and the corresponding implementation in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "If you never studied linear algebra or machine learning,\n",
    "then your past experience with math probably consisted\n",
    "of thinking about one number at a time.\n",
    "And, if you ever balanced a checkbook\n",
    "or even paid for dinner at a restaurant\n",
    "then you already know how to do basic things\n",
    "like adding and multiplying pairs of numbers.\n",
    "For example, the temperature in Palo Alto is $52$ degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
    "Formally, we call values consisting\n",
    "of just one numerical quantity *scalars*.\n",
    "If you wanted to convert this value to Celsius\n",
    "(the metric system's more sensible temperature scale),\n",
    "you would evaluate the expression $c = \\frac{5}{9}(f - 32)$, setting $f$ to $52$.\n",
    "In this equation, each of the terms---$5$, $9$, and $32$---are scalar values.\n",
    "The placeholders $c$ and $f$ are called *variables*\n",
    "and they represent unknown scalar values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, we adopt the mathematical notation\n",
    "where scalar variables are denoted\n",
    "by ordinary lower-cased letters (e.g., $x$, $y$, and $z$).\n",
    "We denote the space of all (continuous) *real-valued* scalars by $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "For expedience, we will punt on rigorous definitions\n",
    "of what precisely *space* is,\n",
    "but just remember for now that the expression $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "is a formal way to say that $x$ is a real-valued scalar.\n",
    "The symbol $\\in$ can be pronounced \"in\"\n",
    "and simply denotes membership in a set.\n",
    "Analogously, we could write $x, y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$\n",
    "to state that $x$ and $y$ are numbers\n",
    "whose value can only be $0$ or $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**A scalar is represented by a tensor with just one element.**)\n",
    "In the next snippet, we instantiate two scalars\n",
    "and perform some familiar arithmetic operations with them,\n",
    "namely addition, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.\n"

    "that if we scale all the elements of a vector\n",

    "\n",
    "That makes sense, as in most contexts the smallest *size* for anything is 0.\n",

    "* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors are basic mathematical objects in linear algebra.\n",
    "* Vectors generalize scalars, and matrices generalize vectors.\n",
    "* Scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors have zero, one, two, and an arbitrary number of axes, respectively.\n",
    "* A tensor can be reduced along the specified axes by `sum` and `mean`.\n",
    "* Elementwise multiplication of two matrices is called their Hadamard product. It is different from matrix multiplication.\n",
    "* In deep learning, we often work with norms such as the $L_1$ norm, the $L_2$ norm, and the Frobenius norm.\n",
    "* We can perform a variety of operations over scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors.\n",
